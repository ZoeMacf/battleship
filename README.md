## User Experience (UX) 

### Initial Discussion

This program will replicate the classic strategy game Battleship by allowing the user to try and guess the locations of the computer's ships and take them out. 

#### User Goals
 - I want the user to be able to easily play a game of Battleship by guessing the location of the various boats. 
 - I want the rules to be easily accessible for first time players.
